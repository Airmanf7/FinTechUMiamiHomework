​
## Overview and Origin
​
* Terra, website: terra.money
​
* The company was founded in January 2018. Terra also consists of a group of businesses including Terraform Labs which was the original entity that supports Terra.money. Terraform labs exists to provide research and supports investment into startup businesses that wish to work with Terra. Other business modules include Anchor which is the platform to deposit and borrow the stablecoin token UST.
​
* Daniel Shin and Do Kwon based out of South Korea. They have backgrounds working for Microsoft and Apple. Daniel Shin is also the founder of TicketMonster which was founded in 2010. It provides the technology to manage online transactions for various events including sporting and concerts. In 2014 it was acquired by Groupon for $260 million. Do Kwon founded Anyfi.io which is a technology that allows users to share Wi-Fi connections among devices so that even if a device is out of range of a Wi-Fi base it would be able to connect. The technology is labeled a Wi-Fi mesh network.
​
* The founders envisioned a stablecoin that combines the benefits of fiat and a crypto coin based on a blockchain. Other popular stable coins are backed by deposits of fiat held in trust along with other securities such as commercial paper and government bonds. Some of these alternative stablecoins include Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). Terra achieves price stability with an elastic money supply enabled by mining incentives. Terra is also a proof-of-stake (PoS) method and according to their governance documentation only the top 130 node operators are granted the ability to maintain a node to validate and sign transactions within a block. PoS is generally thought to be superior than the Proof of Work (PoW) method of transaction validation used to mine bitcoin. PoW is very resource intensive as it requires high hash rates (defined by number of computations per second) to mine a block and earn rewards as a result. PoS is less resource intensive as it incentivizes miners and validators to run stable nodes and only sign valid transactions. Validators stake the terra crypto coin LUNA and individuals can also delegate their LUNA to the validator to participate in the rewards. If a validator does not achieve consensus with the other validators on a transaction due to it being fraudulent the validator may have to burn (lose) some of their stake.
