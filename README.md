## Overview and Origin

### Name of business: Terra

### Website: terra.money

<p>The company was founded in January 2018. Terra also consists of a group of businesses including Terraform Labs which was the original entity that supports Terra.money. Terraform labs exists to provide research and supports investment into startup businesses that wish to work with Terra. Other business modules include Anchor which is the platform to deposit and borrow the stablecoin token UST.

<p>Daniel Shin and Do Kwon based out of South Korea. They have backgrounds working for Microsoft and Apple. Daniel Shin is also the founder of TicketMonster which was founded in 2010. It provides the technology to manage online transactions for various events including sporting and concerts. In 2014 it was acquired by Groupon for $260 million. Do Kwon founded Anyfi.io which is a technology that allows users to share Wi-Fi connections among devices so that even if a device is out of range of a Wi-Fi base it would be able to connect. The technology is labeled a Wi-Fi mesh network.

<p>The founders envisioned a stablecoin that combines the benefits of fiat and a crypto coin based on a blockchain. Other popular stable coins are backed by deposits of fiat held in trust along with other securities such as commercial paper and government bonds. Some of these alternative stablecoins include Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). Terra achieves price stability with an elastic money supply enabled by mining incentives. Terra is also a proof-of-stake (PoS) method and according to their governance documentation only the top 130 node operators are granted the ability to maintain a node to validate and sign transactions within a block. PoS is generally thought to be superior than the Proof of Work (PoW) method of transaction validation used to mine bitcoin. PoW is very resource intensive as it requires high hash rates (defined by number of computations per second) to mine a block and earn rewards as a result. PoS is less resource intensive as it incentivizes miners and validators to run stable nodes and only sign valid transactions. Validators stake the terra crypto coin LUNA and individuals can also delegate their LUNA to the validator to participate in the rewards. If a validator does not achieve consensus with the other validators on a transaction due to it being fraudulent the validator may have to burn (lose) some of their stake. 
 
 
<p>The initial issuance ofthe LUNA token was $1 billion. The initial allocations are as follows:
 
* **10%** to Terraform Labs to continue research and development of the Terra Project. 
 
* **20%** to employee and contributor pool for compensation to personnel. 
 
* **20%** to Terra Alliance which will primarily engage in marketing initiatives to incentivise innovation and new projects.
 
* **20%** held in reserve to help maintain stability.
 
* **26%** from investors. There were 3 rounds of token sales that also funded development.  The first round raised $100 million in LUNA tokens which carried a 12 month lock up period. The second round was another $100 million in tokens with variable lockup periods of 10-18 months. The final round was a private sale of $60 million in tokens with a lockup period of 3 months. 


## Business Activities:

* Terra is seeking to allow users to have confidence in a stable crypto coin entirely based on a crypto token. This differs from other stable coins which back their stable crypto coin with fiat and other traditional financial instruments. A stable coin backed by crypto could be seen as more transparent as the backing instruments are more transparent as they reside on the blockchain. The contrast is a coin such as Tether (USDT) which has claimed to be backed by 50% fiat, but reports have indicated this figure may be as low as 10%. They have drawn criticism as recently as May and June 2021 questioning the validity of these figures. Tether has promised a full audit will be coming soon.

* The intended customer is both individuals seeking a crypto backed stable coin and developers seeking to develop applications that use the token toprimarily  facilitate marketplace transactions. One of the biggest developers is a payment processing app called CHAI which is used in digital payment transactions primarily in the South Korean market. the company charges a 3% fee for each transaction similar to US based companies such as PayPal and CashApp. The market size and customer base is likely to continue to grow as the need to have secure transactions in a stable currency is an import factor in any economy. 
 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
 

## Landscape:

* They are primarily participating in the peer to peer transaction processing and peer to business transaction processing. They also encourage developers to build new decentralized apps (Dapps) that take advantage of their blockchain ecosystem.

<p>This domain is relatively new, but decentralized finance continues to be a major trend in the industry. A good indicator comes from the website CoinGecko.com which tracks many different metrics on thousands of crypto coins. As of Septemter 2018 Coingecko was tracking 2 stable coins, Tether and TrueUSD with market capitalizations of $2.7 billiion and $72 million, respectively. Tether has maintained its position as the top stable coin by market cap since inception. As of September 2021 CoinGecko is tracking 61 stable coins and the combined market cap is $122 billion in USD. 

## Other major competitors include Venus.io, CoinBase.com, Nexo.io, AAVE.com and UniSwap.org.
 
**Venus.io** 
 * This protocol was built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and allows users to supply collateral, earn interest and borrower crypto tokens against the supplied collateral. All interest rates are floating and regulated by an algorithim driven by supply and demand. Individuals can deposit a stable coin, USDC for example, and recieve an equal amount of vUSDC in return which represents the deposit. When the individual wants to redeem their USDC they had in their vUSDC to the protocol and recieve their original deposit plus accumulated interest in return.
 
**Coinbase.com**
 * This business is based on the Ethereum block chain and was an early entrant into the retail crypto exchange industry. They offer a user friendly experience to buy, sell and convert crypto based assets. They also provide educational materials for users to learn about the utility of different crypto projects that have their native coin listed on CoinBase. They also officer CoinBasePro which offers lower trading fees, more charting options and more investment products than CoinBase.com. CoinBase Pro is intended for the advanced investor.
