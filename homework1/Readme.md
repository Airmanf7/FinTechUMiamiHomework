## Overview and Origin

### Name of business: Terra

#### Project within Terra: TerraUSD

### Website: terra.money

<p>The company was founded in January 2018. Terra also consists of a group of businesses including Terraform Labs which was the original entity that supports Terra.money. Terraform labs exists to provide research and supports investment into startup businesses that wish to work with Terra. Other business modules include Anchor which is the platform to deposit and borrow the stablecoin token UST.

<p>Daniel Shin and Do Kwon based out of South Korea. They have backgrounds working for Microsoft and Apple. Daniel Shin is also the founder of TicketMonster which was founded in 2010. It provides the technology to manage online transactions for various events including sporting and concerts. In 2014 it was acquired by Groupon for $260 million. Do Kwon founded Anyfi.io which is a technology that allows users to share Wi-Fi connections among devices so that even if a device is out of range of a Wi-Fi base it would be able to connect. The technology is labeled a Wi-Fi mesh network.

<p>The founders envisioned a stablecoin that combines the benefits of fiat and a crypto coin based on a blockchain. Other popular stable coins are backed by deposits of fiat held in trust along with other securities such as commercial paper and government bonds. Some of these alternative stablecoins include Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). Terra achieves price stability with an elastic money supply enabled by mining incentives. Terra is also a proof-of-stake (PoS) method and according to their governance documentation only the top 130 node operators are granted the ability to maintain a node to validate and sign transactions within a block. PoS is generally thought to be superior than the Proof of Work (PoW) method of transaction validation used to mine bitcoin. PoW is very resource intensive as it requires high hash rates (defined by number of computations per second) to mine a block and earn rewards as a result. PoS is less resource intensive as it incentivizes miners and validators to run stable nodes and only sign valid transactions. Validators stake the terra crypto coin LUNA and individuals can also delegate their LUNA to the validator to participate in the rewards. If a validator does not achieve consensus with the other validators on a transaction due to it being fraudulent the validator may have to burn (lose) some of their stake. 
 
 
<p>The initial issuance ofthe LUNA token was $1 billion. The initial allocations are as follows:
 
* **10%** to Terraform Labs to continue research and development of the Terra Project. 
 
* **20%** to employee and contributor pool for compensation to personnel. 
 
* **20%** to Terra Alliance which will primarily engage in marketing initiatives to incentivise innovation and new projects.
 
* **20%** held in reserve to help maintain stability.
 
* **26%** from investors. There were 3 rounds of token sales that also funded development.  The first round raised $100 million in LUNA tokens which carried a 12 month lock up period. The second round was another $100 million in tokens with variable lockup periods of 10-18 months. The final round was a private sale of $60 million in tokens with a lockup period of 3 months. 


## Business Activities:

<p>Terra is seeking to allow users to have confidence in a stable crypto coin entirely based on a crypto token. This differs from other stable coins which back their stable crypto coin with fiat and other traditional financial instruments. A stable coin backed by crypto could be seen as more transparent as the backing instruments are more transparent as they reside on the blockchain. The contrast is a coin such as Tether (USDT) which has claimed to be backed by 50% fiat, but reports have indicated this figure may be as low as 10%. They have drawn criticism as recently as May and June 2021 questioning the validity of these figures. Tether has promised a full audit will be coming soon.

<p>The intended customer is both individuals seeking a crypto backed stable coin and developers seeking to develop applications that use the token toprimarily  facilitate marketplace transactions. One of the biggest developers is a payment processing app called CHAI which is used in digital payment transactions primarily in the South Korean market. the company charges a 3% fee for each transaction similar to US based companies such as PayPal and CashApp. The market size and customer base is likely to continue to grow as the need to have secure transactions in a stable currency is an import factor in any economy. 
 

<p>They are using blockchain technology as their eco system is based on their Terra blockchain they built. They also use auto balancing algorithims to maintain the price of their stable coins. This is done by either increasing the supply of the governance token, LUNA, or decreasing it by burning LUNA to maintin the peg to the fiat currency.
 

## Landscape:

<p>They are primarily participating in the peer to peer transaction processing and peer to business transaction processing. They also encourage developers to build new decentralized apps (Dapps) that take advantage of their blockchain ecosystem.

<p>This domain is relatively new, but decentralized finance continues to be a major trend in the industry. A good indicator comes from the website CoinGecko.com which tracks many different metrics on thousands of crypto coins. As of Septemter 2018 Coingecko was tracking 2 stable coins, Tether and TrueUSD with market capitalizations of $2.7 billiion and $72 million, respectively. Tether has maintained its position as the top stable coin by market cap since inception. As of September 2021 CoinGecko is tracking 61 stable coins and the combined market cap is $122 billion in USD. 

## Other major competitors include Venus.io, CoinBase.com, Nexo.io, AAVE.com and UniSwap.org.
 
**Venus.io** 
 * This protocol was built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and allows users to supply collateral, earn interest and borrower crypto tokens against the supplied collateral. All interest rates are floating and regulated by an algorithim driven by supply and demand. Individuals can deposit a stable coin, USDC for example, and recieve an equal amount of vUSDC in return which represents the deposit. When the individual wants to redeem their USDC they had in their vUSDC to the protocol and recieve their original deposit plus accumulated interest in return. Venus.io is a decentralized platform and only requires users to connect their crypto wallet to interact with the protocol.
 
**Coinbase.com**
 * This business is based on the Ethereum block chain and was an early entrant into the retail crypto exchange industry. They offer a user friendly experience to buy, sell and convert crypto based assets. They also provide educational materials for users to learn about the utility of different crypto projects that have their native coin listed on CoinBase. They also officer CoinBasePro which offers lower trading fees, more charting options and more investment products than CoinBase.com. CoinBase Pro is intended for the advanced investor. Coinbase.com is a centralized exchange. All new users must complete identity verification steps in order to interact with the exchange.
 
**Nexo.io**
 * This protocol is based in Switzerland and also based on the Ethereum blockchain. Its primary product is allowing users to deposit, earn interest and borrow against their supplied collateral. One of their competitive advantages is allowing users to borrower up to 90% of a deposited stable coin balance. They also offer fixed interest rates and flexible repayment terms. Users can make periodic payments, but are not required to follow a fixed payment schedule. If the borrowed balance exceeds the maximum LTV limit the borrower faces automatic liquidation and additional fees to bring the balance back in line. Nexo.io incentivizes users to hold their native token, NEXO, by offering lower borrowing rates based on the amount in tokens held. They are working on releasing a crypto based credit card. Similar to Coinbase.com, Nexo.io is a centralized exchange. All new users must complete identity verification steps in order to interact with the exchange.
 
**AAVE.com**
 * This protocol combines features of Venus.io and Nexo.io in that it is primarily a platform to deposit, earn and borrower crypto assets. It is based on the Ethereum blockchain. AAVE.com has several competitive advantages over its peers. It offers users the ability to switch between fixed and variable interest rates at will. It also offers many tokens to deposit and borrow. The amount in token that users can borrow is based on the characteristics of that token. For example, users will be able to borrower more against their stable coin than against a crypto coin that is more volitile. Users have the ability to buy the governance token, AAVE and stake them to the protocol. When staked, users cannot withdraw them unless they first unstake them. Users with staked AAVE tokens earn rewards paid in AAVE. The rewards come from trading fees and interest paid by borrowers.  If a liquidation event occurs some AAVE is burned to cover the loss. AAVE.com is a decentralized platform and only requires users to connect their crypto wallet to interact with the protocol.
 
 **Uniswap.org**
  * This protocol is one of the earliest of its kind - a decentralized platform to swap crypto tokens, provide liquidity and earn a share of the trading fees in return. It is built on the Ethereum network. Users spend Ethereum tokens to swap a crypto coin to a differrent coin. Liquidity provders deposit their coins into a pool and their rewards are based on their share of the pool. According to their website, info.uniswap.org, the total value locked as of September 7, 2021 is $2.71 billion and in the last 24 hours trading volume was $2.16 billion. According to CoinGecko.com their current market capitalization as of September 2, 2021 is $12.9 billion. Uniswap.org is known for being a popular protocoll to fork. New protocols can perform a fork and use a lot of the digital infrastructure from the UniSwap code to create a new protocol that may offer different features or improve upon those that already exist.


## Results

<p> According to their documentation they now have more than 2 million unique users and $1 billion in transaction volume per year. They are well positioned to attract new investors, developers and individual customers. They have been mentioned in oneline financial outlets such as Yahoo! Finance and Bloomberg. Growth strategies include TerraForm Capital which provides fiancnail backing for project that want to build on their blockchain and TerraBridge which is a mechanism for sending a crypto token coss chain. An example might be purchasing USDC on the Terra chain and using TerraBridge to send it to a BinanceSmart Chain wallet. They envision the industry continuing to move toward an increased ease of cross chain networking such that it becomes essentially seamless.

<p>Main core metrics include the following:
 
*Market Capitalization
*Market Share
*Trading Volume
 
<p>According to Coingecko.com, currently TerraUSD has a market capitalization of $2.4 billion, a market share of 2.05% among stable coins and a daily trading volume range in August 2021 of $22 million as a low and $180 million as the high. This is up from January 2021, when market capitalization was $268 milliion, a market share of 0.74% among stable coins and a daily trading volume range of $7 million as a low at the beginning of the month of January 2021 and $55 million as the high by the end of the month.

<p>Among stable coin competitos TerraUSD is in the top 7 in terms of core metrics, but consistently ranked 5th at any given time. However, in 2020 the top ranked stable coin was Tether with enjoyed a market share of 74% as of YE 2020. Its competitors such as USDC, DAI, BUSD and TerraUSD have all been experiencing an increase in these core metrics along side eachother resulting in Tether losing market share. This can indicate that over time market share will even out and those coins and companies that offer valuable and unique features should remain even though the asset may be seen as fungible. The value TerraUSD should continue to focus on offering is strong stability, scalability, valuable features, attractiveness to developers, ease of use and wisespread public adoption.
 
## Recommendations
 
 <P>Terra should look at its competiros across all chains and mirror the unique features that make each stand out. They should also incentivize developers the specifically target those unique features and being them to the Terra eco system. This could be done with targeted marketing and special reward incentives for specific projects. This will combine market driven competitiion with guideance from Terra to drive innovations they would like to provide for their users.
  
 <p>Specific recommendations include the following

**Offer a stable borrowing rate product, similar to that offered by AAVE.com.**
 
 * Stability in any financial product will always be desireable. A stable interest rate on a stable coin will provide instant value in a market of users that get value from Terra's other products and features.
   
  **Make certain to have a strong, experienced regulation and compliance department early and make it a high priority to be in compliance in every aspect of the business.** In finance, not heeding a country's regulations can lead to severe complications, fines and the possibility of being banned from doing business. The better strategy would be to make the investment upfront to be in compliance to avoid a possible total loss of investment resulting from a shutdown of the business in a market.
   
  **Consider offering a crypto based debit and/or credit card**
   
   * People will always value a higher degree of access to their money. In finance, since regulations and consumer protections are of high importance the developement and issuance of such cards would likely have a long timeline. Factors that would lead to this are regulatory approval, security screening and customer screening. It may actually be useful for Terra to go through the steps in considering a physical card even if the conculsion is the costs and risks outweigh potential benefits. 
   
 **Consider additional marketing strategies and advertisement to gain market share**
   
   * It appears TerraUSD does not have a strong presence on Facebook and low interaction on Twitter. They should use those and other social media platforms to gain attention and drive more adoption of their products. The benefits to higher market share are the attraction not only of customers, but talent in the form of employees and third party developers. Considering the amount of data publicly available programs to search for people to direct target marketing campaigns would have a high amount of utility. Also, educational forums will always attract people seeking to learn new information and gain new skills. They should hold events, both virutally and in person to increase their visibility in the maretplace.
